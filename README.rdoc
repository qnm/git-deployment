= gitflow: a Capistrano recipe for git deployment using tags in a multistage environment.

The best thing about this recipe is that there is almost nothing to learn -- your cap deploy process barely changes.
Gitflow simply adds some tagging/logging/workflow magic.

    # BEFORE
    $ cap deploy              # 'master' goes to staging
    $ cap production deploy   # 'master' goes to production

    # AFTER
    $ cap deploy                                                          
    # 'master' goes to staging; tag staging-YYYY-MM-DD.X created

    $ cap production deploy
    # deploys latest staging tag, or if last tag is a production tag then that, to production
    # displays a commit log of what will be pushed to production, requests confirmation before deploying
    # tag 'staging-YYYY-MM-DD-X' goes to production
    # tag 'production-YYYY-MM-DD-X' created; points to staging-YYYY-MM-DD-X

    # BONUS
    $ cap gitflow:commit_log              
    # displays a commit log pushed to staging
    
    $ cap production gitflow:commit_log   
    # displays a commit log of what will be pushed to production

== INSTALLATION

First, install the gem:

    gem install capistrano-gitflow

Then update config/deploy.rb

    require 'capistrano/ext/multistage'
    require 'capistrano/gitflow' # needs to come after multistage

== DETAILS

After experimenting with several workflows for deployment in git, I've finally found one I really like.

* You can push to staging at any time; every staging push is automatically tagged with a unique tag.
* You can only push a staging tag to production. This helps to enforce QA of all pushes to production.
* If you specify :remote and in your Cap config, you can use the latest commit from that remote instead of the origin default.
  E.g. set :remote, 'upstream'
* You can specify :gitflow_check, false to tag and push the current master as staging without comparing your local commits.
  E.g. set :gitflow_check, false


=== PUSH TO STAGING

Whenever you want to push the currently checked-out code to staging, just do:

    cap staging deploy

gitflow will automatically:

* create a unique tag in the format of 'staging-YYYY-MM-DD.X'
* configure multistage to use that tag for the deploy
* push the code and tags to the remote configured as :remote in your Cap config - defaults to "origin"
* and run the normal deploy task for the staging stage.

=== PUSH TO PRODUCTION:

Whenever you want to push code to production, just do:

    cap production deploy

gitflow will automatically:

* determine the last staging tag created, show a commit log of last-production-tag..last-staging-tag
* (alternatively, specify the tag to push to production via `-s tag=staging-YYYY-MM-DD-X-user-description`
* prompt for confirmation of deploy
* alias the staging tag to a production tag like: production-2008-09-08.2
* configure multistage to use that tag for the deploy
* push the code and tags to the remote "origin"
* and run the normal deploy task for the production stage.

=== NOTES:

* you may need to wipe out the cached-copy on the remote server that cap uses when switching to this workflow; I have seen situations where the cached copy cannot cleanly checkout to the new branch/tag. it's safe to try without wiping it out first, it will fail gracefully.
* if your stages already have a "set :branch, 'my-staging-branch'" call in your configs, remove it. This workflow configures it automatically.
